https://twitter.com/APompliano/status/1748761862575952040#m,"Here are a few ideas on financial markets that will make you think more critically:  1. Tech will continue to outperform - many people think the tech sectors' recent outperformance means we are headed towards another Dot Com bust, but the deflationary aspect of technology, along with the global adoption now available for these products, will probably keep the outperformance going for years to come.  2. Historical stock valuations are likely wrong - investors used to allocate to stocks simply to capture a potential reward, but now a good portion of investors are also allocating to stocks to hide from higher inflation levels. This leads to a new monetary premium on stock valuations that will render historical valuations less useful.  3. The 60/40 portfolio will die - the legacy thought process was that this allocation mix could protect investors, but we saw over the last few years that stocks and bonds both went down, so the theory didn't work as intended. The new generation, which has less trust in central banks, will shun bonds and the largest Treasury buyers (foreign central banks) are also showing less interest.  4. All assets will become digital over time - the transition from analog assets to electronic CUSIPs created trillions of dollars in value. The shift from electronic to digital will be even bigger (ex: stablecoins already proving this) and an asset like bitcoin will eventually have higher market cap than gold.   5. Countries will have to retrain workers - wages have no chance of keeping up with inflation, so countries will have to make large investments in retraining workers. They will move too slowly and entire generations will suffer. The best path would be to redesign the education system from the ground up, but that is also the hardest path.   6. There will be a renaissance of small business globally - historically these small businesses were physical locations on Main Street, but now they are ecommerce stores, content creators, and digital agencies. As labor creates these businesses, there will be little capital invested, so the returns captured by Main Street business investors in past decades will disappear.   7. Developed nations will continue electing radical economic thinkers - the internet open-sourced information and the countries in the worst economic positions will take a flyer on disruptive politicians. You can see Bukele in El Salvador and Milei in Argentina as examples, but these innovators have better chance of turning these economies around than traditional politicians.   8. Demographics will become less important signal for investors - the demographics data has always told the story of economies and markets, but that will change with the rise of robotics. You won't need to measure demographics of humans, but rather the production lines of robot manufacturers. Whichever economy has the most robots, wins.   9. Inflation targets will increase - central banks find themselves in a bad position and have no choice but to stick with loose monetary policy over the long-term. They will increase their inflation targets to 3% or more, so they can continue to present a sense of control over economies, although the true inflation number will always be higher than reported.   10. Traditional economic data will be exposed for inaccuracy - legacy investors have been using data that is flawed to make decisions. The collection is filled with issues (ex: we send physical humans into grocery stores to report prices), the methodology is inaccurate (ex: weighted baskets can't ever reflect accurate inflation), and the conclusions are erroneous (ex: every person has a different inflation number). Getting new data will change the way capital is allocated & be the foundation for the future.   -------  This list is not comprehensive of everything that will change, but this is a decent overview of various evolutions I have been thinking about.   I would love to learn what you think about these, while also hearing what other ones you think are important.

https://twitter.com/MwangoCapital/status/1749311489737941258#m,"The latest IMF report shows that 20 of 39 Kenyan banks were accessing the discount window.   Here are a few notes on the discount window:  —What is a Discount Window? This is a tool used by central banks to provide short-term loans to eligible financial institutions, such as commercial banks when they need additional liquidity. It is a form of lender of last resort, meaning that it is a safety net for institutions that are unable to borrow from other sources. —Loan Terms: Short-term, usually overnight, at higher-than-average rates (the discount rate) to discourage excessive use. The central banks decide on loan approval based on genuine needs. —Roles of Window: Ensures liquidity in the financial system and maintains financial stability by aiding temporarily struggling institutions. Also allows central banks to influence monetary policy via the discount rate (By raising or lowering the discount rate, the central bank can encourage or discourage borrowing by banks, which in turn affects the money supply and interest rates in the broader economy.) —Liquidity Sources: Banks have access to several liquidity sources: interbank market, horizontal repos, vertical repos, and the central bank's discount window. In Kenya, the discount rate is usually the Central Bank Rate + 400bps while the Interbank rate oscillates between the bands of CBR ± 250bps —Discount Window Stigma: Stigma arises when banks are hesitant to use the discount window, even when they may be facing financial difficulties because they fear that borrowing from the central bank could signal to the public and other market participants that they are in financial trouble or facing liquidity problems. —Mitigating Stigma: To mitigate this stigma, central banks offer anonymous borrowing to reduce stigma. This is one reason why it is hard to know which banks have tapped into the window. Some central banks, like the US one, want to force all banks to use it at least once a year to reduce the stigma.  In short, the use of the discount window should be encouraged not discouraged.","Jan 22, 2024 · 6:02 AM UTC",105,12,-0.4295

Beijing has long kept its financial markets relatively closed. It worried that if the West’s money giants were allowed free rein, they would destabilize this critical area of the Chinese economy -- deliberately or otherwise. After all, as capitalism’s ultimate icons, Western players dominate global finance today.  Finally, however, China’s leaders seem ready to take on the challenge. At a meeting attended by the entire Politburo Standing Committee, Xi Jinping announced a preliminary plan for the country to vault into the top ranks of world financial powers.  Details are sketchy at this early stage. But a core feature is that the Chinese model of finance would be different from the Western paradigm in at least one critical aspect. While the West’s system is based on fiat money and financialization, China’s will be built on the real economy -- the nation’s strong suit as the world’s industrial and trading superpower.  Watch the space. The Chinese may have launched yet another globally transformative initiative. Western elites be watching closely -- with both anticipation and trepidation.  “President Xi Jinping on Tuesday laid out a concrete definition for how China would become a financial superpower and called its system ‘distinct from Western models’, two months after the goal was presented at the central financial work conference…  “ ‘A financial superpower should be based on a strong economic foundation,’ Xi was quoted by state outlet Xinhua as saying. ‘It must have world-leading economic, technological and comprehensive national strength’…  “Major differences from the Western models, Xi said, include the Communist Party’s leadership and the emphasis on financing support for the real economy. He also stressed fundamentals, saying a strong currency, central bank, financial institutions both domestic and international are key to superpower status, as well as strong supervision and talent.”  https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3248669/chinas-xi-jinping-lays-out-road-map-becoming-financial-superpower-warns-risk-can-throw-efforts-track","Jan 17, 2024 · 3:40 AM UTC",484,24,0.9753

https://twitter.com/MakisMD/status/1749036548853813730#m,"NEW ARTICLE: CHAGA MUSHROOM (Inonotus Obliquus) - powerful antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic and anti-cancer properties - Canada leads Chaga research with 2 new peer-reviewed papers in Nov.2023!  Chaga Mushroom is one of 5 key medicinal mushrooms I'm doing deep dive on  Chaga (Inonotus Obliquus) is a tree parasitic fungus that causes decomposition of live trunks, mainly 30-50 year old birch trees.  It is known for having many bioactive substances: antioxidants, triterpenoids (inotodiol, betulin, betulinic acid), ergosterol and its peroxide, sesquiterpenes, benzoic acid derivatives, hispidin analogues, and melanins   Biological Properties include:  Chaga is an anti-viral: Chaga polysaccharides inhibit HIV and HCV viral replication and entry into cells  Chaga is an Antioxidant/ROS Scavenger: it decreases ROS in normal cells, increases ROS in cancer cells (reactive oxygen species end up killing cancer cells)  Chaga is an anti-diabetic: decreases fasting serum glucose, plasma insulin levels, body weight and expands pancreatic islet cells. In studies it alleviated obesity-related complications in diabetic rats.  Anti-Cancer Properties:  - intensifies apoptosis - decreases expression of NF-κB - decreases expression of matrix metalloproteinases which reduces metastasis  Those who drink Chaga Tea get the benefits of bioactive compounds that are water extracted, like the polysaccharides that were thought to be the main anti-cancer elements of Chaga.  However, all types of extractions yield cancer fighting compounds, but the problem is how to get the most bioavailable versions of them.  Chaga also suppresses Th2 and Th17 immune response and stimulates Th1-derived responses (IFN-γ production). Why does this matter?   Th1-derived IFN-γ is shown to render macrophages directly cytotoxic to cancer cells. (Key)  I review 5 RECENT peer-reviewed papers on benefits of Chaga Mushrooms.  Did you know Canada is leading Chaga Mushroom Research with two new papers published in November 2023 and they're really good papers?  2023 Nov (Cheung et al) - Wild Chaga (Inonotus obliquus) modulates inflammation, neural cell survival and inhibits proliferation of cancer cells (Canada, published in Pharmacological Research - Modern Chinese Medicine)  2023 Nov (Plehn et al) - Chaga mushroom triterpenoids as adjuncts to minimally invasive cancer therapies: A review (Canada)  Latest Canadian research by Cheung et al shows Chaga water extracts inhibit human glioblastoma and human pancreatic cancer proliferation (these are two of the most aggressive Turbo Cancers caused by Pfizer & Moderna COVID-19 mRNA Vaccines) - this is a NEW development  Prior research also shows cancer cells lines that responded to Chaga included: human colorectal, liver, lung, breast, prostate and mouse melanoma, as well as ovarian, cervical, leukemia and sarcoma.  I also found the “anti-fatigue activity of Chaga” fascinating when researchers (2021 Lu et al) - Recent Developments in Inonotus obliquus (Chaga mushroom) Polysaccharides: Isolation, Structural Characteristics, Biological Activities and Application)  used the “mice swimming model” - Chaga increased mouse climbing time, swimming time, reduced immobile time, reduced blood lactic acid, urea nitrogen, LDH levels.

https://twitter.com/kshaughnessy2/status/1748390514045370697#m,"""This (fight) could be bigger than tobacco"" - FORBES article 2002   The fight to expose the counterfeit shares flooding our financial markets started decades ago.  That's how big this fight is. You'll find a familiar ""voice"" in this Forbes article from 2002.    When you call out illegal behavior they come for you, your family and your livelihood That's how they fight back. The closer to the target you get the dirtier and messier the fight gets.  ""The victims were smallish companies traded on the Nasdaq Bulletin Board. Christian and his clients claim the Canadian bankers and others exploited lax oversight of this market by the National Association of Securities Dealers, selling stock they didn’t have–”naked” short-selling. Stockbrokers can sometimes get away with it, if the buyers of shorted shares don’t demand to see the certificates. It’s on this very point that one alleged victim has decided to fight back. Gary Valinoti , chairman of JagNotes.com , a tiny media company, needed cash to build a TV station for his online stock-news service. So he agreed to take down $10 million in convertible preferred financing. It seemed to be a better deal than selling common at $3 a share. As soon as JagNotes booked the investment, the share price began to fall. Much to Valinoti’s puzzlement, the stock continued falling, in good times and bad. He was further baffled by the list of large shareholders, required to disclose their holdings each month, which showed no selloffs. And yet by February 2001, the stock was trading at 10 cents. “Everybody I knew was buying, but who the hell was selling?” Valinoti wondered.  He concluded it had to be naked short-sellers. Instead of suing his tormentors, Valinoti decided to call their bluff. In February 2002 he announced a recapitalization plan, reconstituting JagNotes common stock into new Class A and B shares. To receive new issues, shareholders had to hand in their old stock certificates. The recap took effect Apr. 8. As brokerages began sending in certificates on behalf of their clients, gaps appeared. Citibank’s beneficial holder list, for example, accounted for 6,300 shares; one investor claimed he owns 1.2 million shares through his Citibank account. Brokerages that didn’t bother to demand certificates when clients bought JagNotes shares are in a jam. Morgan Stanley has a deficit of 500,000 shares, reports JagNotes. UBS Paine Webber seems to be missing 252,000 shares. Eventually brokers must collect from whoever sold them the phantom shares. Meantime they may have to buy on the open market to cover their clients’ positions. That should drive up the shares of JagNotes and generate a windfall for Valinoti, who owns 5 million shares. Recent price: 39 cents. Expect a fierce fight. O’Quinn has already spent about $3 million on discovery. He’ll keep spending because, he says, “This could be bigger than tobacco.”  @HAMShortkiller @BasileEsq @faulkingtruth @busybrands @anna_trades @JunkSavvy @ace_indy_biz @Rahraw999 @JennyL1818 @WilliamPFarran1 $FNGR $GTII $MMTLP $ENZC https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2002/0610/046.html","Jan 19, 2024 · 5:02 PM UTC",313,12,0.1997

This enhances traditional financial markets and revolutionizes investments through: • Liquidity • Transparency • Accessibility  Let's deep dive deeper:  1. Why RWAs Matter in DeFi❓  RWAs bring essential value to DeFi by connecting the blockchain digital realm with real-world assets.  This integration with DeFi lowers risks, and attracts traditional investors with well-established values and market behaviors.  Tokenization and smart contracts enable simultaneous settlement, automate processes, and enhance financial inclusivity.  2. Challenges & Opportunities 🗒️  While RWAs in DeFi face regulatory challenges and security concerns, future trends indicate potential growth.  As regulatory frameworks adapt, investor confidence and institutional involvement are expected to rise.  Improved interoperability, advancements in blockchain technology, and the integration of the IoT for real-time asset monitoring could further enhance the landscape.  3. Future Trends & Developments 🚀  Tokenized RWAs suggest increased investor confidence, institutional engagement, and a globally interconnected ecosystem.  Improvements in blockchain and DeFi may lead to more sophisticated income-generating opportunities and innovative financial products.  Additionally, tokenization of asset classes like intellectual property and carbon credits could broaden investment horizons.  4. Unit Network Take 🧠  Unit Network builds powerful and accessible DeFi products that allow anyone in the world to build, manage and scale a token economy.  We are connecting providers, customers and real world assets to build a global community and decentralised financial infrastructure.  It's all about everyone having access to participate in the global economy with powerful, transparent and simple financial tools.

https://twitter.com/ProblemSniper/status/1747680630757089476#m,"You often see me talk about market internals. What are they? How do you use it for your advantage?  Market internals refer to a set of technical indicators and data that provide insight into the overall health and condition of the financial markets, specifically the stock market. These indicators help traders and analysts gauge the underlying strength or weakness of the market beyond just looking at stock prices. Market internals typically include the following:  1. Advance-Decline Line: This indicator tracks the number of advancing (rising) stocks minus the number of declining (falling) stocks in a given market index, like the S&P 500. A rising advance-decline line suggests broad market strength, while a declining line indicates weakness. 2. Up Volume and Down Volume: These measure the total trading volume of stocks that are up (gaining) and down (losing) for a particular trading session. High up volume relative to down volume can indicate bullish sentiment, and vice versa. 3. New Highs and New Lows: These indicators count the number of stocks reaching new 52-week highs and new 52-week lows. A higher number of new highs suggests market strength, while an increasing number of new lows can indicate weakness. 4. Tick Index: The tick index measures the number of stocks on an uptick (their last trade was at a higher price than the previous trade) minus the number of stocks on a downtick (their last trade was at a lower price than the previous trade). It can provide intraday insights into market sentiment. 5. Put-Call Ratio: This ratio compares the total number of put options (bearish bets) to call options (bullish bets) traded in the options market. A high put-call ratio may suggest increased fear or bearish sentiment among traders. 6. Volatility Index (VIX): While not technically a market internal, the VIX measures market volatility and is often used to gauge investor sentiment. A rising VIX can indicate increased uncertainty and potential market declines.  Market internals are essential tools for traders and analysts to assess the market’s breadth and depth, helping them make more informed trading decisions. These indicators can reveal whether a market rally or decline is broad-based or driven by a few select stocks, providing valuable insights into market trends and potential reversals.

Look at what's happening – Ukraine vs Russia, Taiwan vs China, Pakistan vs Iran, Israel vs Palestine, The Red Sea attacks, and much more to come...  If you think about it, the economy is essentially just in a hyperspeed version of the past and mirroring itself. Before the 1920s, the Spanish flu hit and decimated millions, it was then followed by a period of economic growth and prosperity known as the ""Roaring Twenties"", After topping out and years of stagnation, it was followed by the Great Depression, and then quickly after, followed by a deadly war that changed everything.  War is always followed by times when economic prosperity flips to economic hardship, creating discontent and anger, leading to hatred, which in turn leads to war. This is why we're witnessing global conflicts escalate so quickly.  We've already seen our decade of prosperity, and that was ended abruptly in 2020 with the pandemic. We also saw a glimpse of the crash; however, nothing monumental yet due to the artificial money printing, but the bubble is just moments away from imploding, and it will all be followed by a global war, as tensions are already building up across the world.","Jan 18, 2024 · 4:03 PM UTC",189,42,-0.976

https://twitter.com/julian2kwan/status/1748478954464596007#m,"Real World Asset #RWA Tokenization will transform the financial markets, take a look back at history to understand how big an opportunity this is, and why we started @IxSwap $IXS  A 🧵  We believe that the transformative forces of tokenization and the indispensable need for efficient issuance and investment processes will ultimately turn the tide for #RWA .   If you look back at the development of the capital markets, technological developments were always the key driver of massive transformation and growth and lead to all the investment vehicles running the financial system today. We dive into how this is also true for #ETFs  and why we believe this will be true for #RWA explosion for the alternatives including real estate, private equity, startups, private credit and debt and other investment assets.  Besides smartphones, social media, U.S. e-commerce retail sales, and industrial robots, #ETFs  (AUM) belong to the fastest-growing fields of technology. ETFs are a perfect example of how technology has shaped the capital markets over decades transforming what started out as a $11 million USD sector into a $6-7 Trillion USD sector today. We want to draw some parallels between the #ETF  story and the development of the #RWA industry.  But let us start from the beginning to understand the nature of this evolutionary process. The first #ETF  was created in 1989 and from that first fund (which was viewed by many as a failure) we now have over 5,000 globally traded #ETFs  and global AUM grew from a few million USD to 5 Trillion USD (AUM).  The #ETF market grew from one fund in 1993 to 102 funds by 2002. By the end of 2009 nearly 1,000 funds were already created. According to ETFGI, there are now 5,000 ETFs trading globally. And we now have...  🚀🚀🚀  The ETF success story and #RWA   So what was the reason for the massive growth of ETFs over the past three decades? The answer is clear: New technology allowed the creation of new investment products offering a wide range of benefits compared to their traditional counterparts. In contrast to costly, illiquid, and complicated mutual funds, ETFs offered new ways of passive investing. ETFs allowed tracking indexes by the use of computers. The graphic below captures some of the resulting benefits. As you might have noticed, this is, in essence, the security tokens story, but it took place 3 decades earlier with the technology of lower capabilities than available today.  The similarities in the benefits between ETFs and #RWA seem remarkable. In comparison to traditional funds, ETFs provided: liquidity, accessibility, lower costs, operational efficiencies, and transparency.  These are the same value propositions offered by #RWA. The difference though is that #RWA provide next-generation technology in the form of blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) which allows for an even better and more efficient issuance and investment process.  Learnings from the #ETF story  One key takeaway from the #ETFs  developments is that the first wave of companies operating in a new technology-driven sector of the financial industry has (at first) to deal with resistance, confusion and lack of understanding. ETFs took off slowly but grew nearly exponentially after 1993. This indicates that it takes time for existing market participants and regulators to fully understand, accept and ultimately implement new technology-driven applications.   However,  the new wave of #RWA is being lead by a new type of founding team,  ex-#TradFi groups, launching new investment products using public blockchains like @base . This is a new world and has the banks on the back foot trying to keep up with the innovation and pace of change, ( I write more on this next week ""Startups versus Incumbents in the #RWA industry""  Secondly, the brave first adopters are the ones who will capture the largest market shares. The most prominent example of this is iShares which debuted its first international ETF in 1996. Today, iShares captures 1.56T USD of a 5.8T USD market and has a total of 357 ETFs being in 4 different asset classes including alternative assets, commodities, fixed income, and equity.  The case of #ETFs  shows how technology can and has radically changed the financial sector. We think that the financial industry is currently at an inflection point. We experience strong and persistent growth in interest and deal flow. More and more traditional market participants see the value in issuing and investing digitally. This gives us further confidence in the pursuit of our vision of a future where all participants in private markets use efficient and cost-effective technology-based platforms to leverage the full return prospects of their assets.  In 2021, @AaronOngsy myself and team we embarked on a mission to build the #Uniswap for #RWA, and that is @IxSwap  Anyone issuing or holding any #RWA can start their first liquidity pools and breath life into the secondary trading of their assets. Pools can start for as little as $10,000 of equity/debt and a trading pair token, never been possible before in the world of real asset investing.   @IxSwap is the Killer application for the #rwa industry.  100% built on public protocols, 100% built towards #DeFi , implementing the innovations and power of #DeFi paired with assets of the real world, $IXS is our native token on @IxSwap that powers transactions and operations of the platform for all users.

Tech will continue to outperform - many people think the tech sectors' recent outperformance means we are headed towards another Dot Com bust, but the deflationary aspect of technology, along with the global adoption now available for these products, will probably keep the outperformance going for years to come.  2. Historical stock valuations are likely wrong - investors used to allocate to stocks simply to capture a potential reward, but now a good portion of investors are also allocating to stocks to hide from higher inflation levels. This leads to a new monetary premium on stock valuations that will render historical valuations less useful.  3. The 60/40 portfolio will die - the legacy thought process was that this allocation mix could protect investors, but we saw over the last few years that stocks and bonds both went down, so the theory didn't work as intended. The new generation, which has less trust in central banks, will shun bonds and the largest Treasury buyers (foreign central banks) are also showing less interest.  4. All assets will become digital over time - the transition from analog assets to electronic CUSIPs created trillions of dollars in value. The shift from electronic to digital will be even bigger (ex: stablecoins already proving this) and an asset like bitcoin will eventually have higher market cap than gold.   5. Countries will have to retrain workers - wages have no chance of keeping up with inflation, so countries will have to make large investments in retraining workers. They will move too slowly and entire generations will suffer. The best path would be to redesign the education system from the ground up, but that is also the hardest path.   6. There will be a renaissance of small business globally - historically these small businesses were physical locations on Main Street, but now they are ecommerce stores, content creators, and digital agencies. As labor creates these businesses, there will be little capital invested, so the returns captured by Main Street business investors in past decades will disappear.   7. Developed nations will continue electing radical economic thinkers - the internet open-sourced information and the countries in the worst economic positions will take a flyer on disruptive politicians. You can see Bukele in El Salvador and Milei in Argentina as examples, but these innovators have better chance of turning these economies around than traditional politicians.   8. Demographics will become less important signal for investors - the demographics data has always told the story of economies and markets, but that will change with the rise of robotics. You won't need to measure demographics of humans, but rather the production lines of robot manufacturers. Whichever economy has the most robots, wins.   9. Inflation targets will increase - central banks find themselves in a bad position and have no choice but to stick with loose monetary policy over the long-term. They will increase their inflation targets to 3% or more, so they can continue to present a sense of control over economies, although the true inflation number will always be higher than reported.   10. Traditional economic data will be exposed for inaccuracy - legacy investors have been using data that is flawed to make decisions. The collection is filled with issues (ex: we send physical humans into grocery stores to report prices), the methodology is inaccurate (ex: weighted baskets can't ever reflect accurate inflation), and the conclusions are erroneous (ex: every person has a different inflation number).

Otherwise, the consensus seems to be that lower interest rates are already priced into the stock prices. What a clowny situation for the interest rates may not drop by a lot, and definitely not to the 2020-21 levels. And if they do then CPI, which is already hard to tame will spin out of control. Either way it’s not an easy situation with economy conditioned to grow only when the interest rates are low. What might be a sustainable solution moving forward is that the definition of low interest rates is adjusted to somewhere around the current levels and let things stabilize, and form a revised baseline for growth. Responsible borrowing will be a byproduct, which may also help both the lender and the borrower in the long term.","Jan 20, 2024 · 5:03 PM UTC",1,0,0.9338

Similarities:  - Both markets are places where financial assets are traded, such as cryptocurrencies, stocks, bonds, etc. - Both markets can generate profits for investors, but there is also a risk of loss. - Both markets are affected by economic, political, and social factors.  Differences:  - Assets traded: The crypto market trades cryptocurrencies, while the stock market trades securities, such as stocks, bonds, etc. - Operating mechanism: The crypto market operates on blockchain technology, while the stock market operates on a system of stock exchanges. - Volatility: The crypto market often has higher volatility than the stock market. - Regulatory mechanism: The crypto market is not regulated by any government agency or organization, while the stock market is regulated by government agencies and financial institutions.

Regulatory mechanism: The crypto market is not regulated by any government agency or organization, while the stock market is regulated by government agencies and financial institutions.  Conclusion The crypto market and the stock market are both potential financial markets that can generate profits for investors. However, each market has its own characteristics and risks. Therefore, investors should research each market carefully before investing.  Here are some additional points to consider when comparing the crypto market and the stock market:  - Liquidity: The crypto market is generally less liquid than the stock market. This means that it can be more difficult to buy and sell cryptocurrencies quickly and at a fair price. - Transparency: The crypto market is less transparent than the stock market. This means that it can be more difficult to get accurate information about the underlying value of cryptocurrencies. - Regulation: The crypto market is not as regulated as the stock market. This means that there is a greater risk of fraud and manipulation in the crypto market.  Ultimately, the best way to choose between investing in the crypto market or the stock market is to consider your individual investment goals and risk tolerance.  #Crypto #BTCUSDT","Jan 20, 2024 · 11:34 AM UTC",93,76,0.4715

But what does this mean for you, and what could the future hold for the world of cryptocurrency investment ?    Let's explore ↓   What is a Bitcoin ETF ? --------------------------------  A Bitcoin ETF is an exchange-traded fund that offers investors exposure to the price movements of Bitcoin.   Unlike owning the cryptocurrency directly, investors can buy and sell shares of a Bitcoin ETF on a stock exchange, making it a more accessible investment vehicle for those who may be hesitant to directly invest in Bitcoin.  Here are the main points on how Bitcoin ETFs work:  ------------------------------  1️⃣. Bitcoin ETFs track the price of Bitcoin by holding either actual BTC or derivatives like futures contracts that follow price movements.   2️⃣. These ETFs are accessible through regular stock markets, making them more appealing to a wider range of investors who may be familiar with traditional investing but cautious about diving into crypto exchanges.   3️⃣. The investment process is simplified as investors can buy and sell shares in the Bitcoin ETF through conventional brokerage accounts, bypassing the need for digital wallets and cryptocurrency exchange accounts.   4️⃣. As Bitcoin ETFs are traded on traditional exchanges, they are subject to regulatory oversight, offering an added layer of security and legitimacy compared to direct crypto investments.  ----------------------------------------------------------------  The SEC has approved the listing and trading of a number of spot Bitcoin ETF shares, including applications from major financial firms such as BlackRock, Ark Investments/21Shares, Fidelity, and VanEck. This approval is expected to lead to a surge in trading activity, with billions of dollars' worth of shares already being traded.  What's Next ? ----------------------------  The approval of these ETFs is likely to trigger intense competition among issuers for market share, with analysts estimating that Bitcoin ETF flows could eventually surpass $10 billion.   This development is expected to further institutionalize Bitcoin as an asset class and provide both institutional and retail investors with easier access to the cryptocurrency.

https://twitter.com/realalexsoro/status/1747166060585865424#m,"Trading success is built on the bedrock of discipline and patience. In the ever-changing landscape of financial markets, the ability to avoid impulsive decisions and adhere to a well-thought-out trading plan becomes paramount. Let's delve into seven actionable tips that not only cultivate patience but also enhance discipline for traders aiming for long-term prosperity.  1️⃣ Define Your Trading Plan with Precision: Begin with a meticulously crafted trading plan. Specify entry and exit criteria, risk tolerance, and overall strategy. This detailed roadmap not only provides clarity but also serves as a constant reference point to deter impulsive deviations. If your strategy dictates a specific price level for entry, patiently wait for the market to reach that level before executing your trade.  2️⃣ Exercise Selective Trade Execution: Patience is a virtue, especially in waiting for high-probability setups. Resist the temptation to jump into every market move. By being selective, you preserve your mental capital and ensure each trade is a well-considered decision. Avoid entering trades simply due to market noise; instead, patiently wait for setups aligning with your strategy.  3️⃣ Master the Art of Waiting: Discipline is honed by mastering the art of waiting. In the midst of market fluctuations, refrain from acting on impulse. Wait for signals, patterns, or confirmation that align with your predetermined strategy. Patience means not succumbing to the urge to exit a trade prematurely during minor market fluctuations.  4️⃣ Implement Progressive Risk Management: Discipline extends to risk management. Implement progressive risk controls, adjusting position sizes based on your evolving account balance. This prevents impulsive decisions during volatile periods and ensures adherence to your risk management plan. Patience involves resisting the desire to increase position sizes during winning streaks, staying consistent with your risk management strategy.  5️⃣ Review and Reflect on Trades: Regular reviews are indispensable for refining your trading approach. Analyze both successful and unsuccessful trades, seeking patterns in your decision-making process. This reflective practice builds discipline and provides invaluable insights for future endeavors. Patience is reflected in taking the time to review trades thoroughly, identifying areas for improvement.  6️⃣ Utilize Trading Simulations: Enhance discipline through simulated trading environments. Practice patience by utilizing demo accounts or backtesting tools like simulators. These platforms allow you to experience various market scenarios without financial risk, fostering a disciplined mindset. Patience is exercised by traders who diligently practice in simulated markets before deploying strategies in real-time.  7️⃣ Cultivate Emotional Resilience: Patience intertwines with emotional resilience. Disciplined traders understand that market conditions can test emotions. Cultivate patience by acknowledging the inevitability of market fluctuations and maintaining composure during challenging times. Patience in the face of a losing streak involves refraining from impulsive revenge trading and sticking to the established plan.  Discipline and patience are not just virtues; they are the cornerstone of successful trading. By incorporating these seven tips into your trading routine, you'll navigate the markets with a steady hand, making decisions rooted in strategy rather than emotion.  #Trading #patience #tuesdayvibe #education","Jan 16, 2024 · 7:57 AM UTC",5,2,0.9618

The story is about Paul Dombey, a cold and domineering businessman who is trying to determine his life and career through his only son, Paul Jr. However, life did not go as he planned when Paul Jr. passed away early.  Dombey feels a heavy sense of loss and begins to see the emptiness in his life. Meanwhile, the work also focuses on Edith Granger, a mysterious and enigmatic woman who is married to Dombey in an unhappy marriage. By linking complex stories and multidimensional characters, Dickens creates a colorful picture of social class and life's challenges.
